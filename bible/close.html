<chapter><h1>Bible: God is closer than we think</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Jacob's story</h1>
  When Jacob was running away from Esau, who was trying to kill him, he stopped for the night at a random place. He had a dream, where he saw a ladder <q>resting on earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.</q> God said to him:

  <blockquote>
    I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac...I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go..
  </blockquote>

  Jacob wasn't aware that God was there in that random place. Any place can become <i>Bethel</i>, the house of God.

<section id="1"><h1>Elisha's story</h1>
  In a city called Dothan, a servant of the prophet Elisha was terrified because they were surrounded by Israel's enemies. "What shall we do?" he cried. Elisha told him to chill out, for <q>those who are with us are more than those who are with them.</q> Then he prayed for him: <q>O Lord, open his eyes so he may see.</q> And the Lord opened his eyes, and he saw that he was surrounded by horses and chariots of fire - the power and protection of God.
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Samuel's story</h1>
  In the temple, in the night, a young boy named Samuel heard his name called out. He thought it was the priest, Eli, and kept running into his bedroom. Finally Eli realised that it was God speaking to Samuel, but Samuel did not yet recognise God's voice. So Eli instructed him that the next time he heard the voice he should assume it was from God. He should invite God to speak further - and be ruthlessly obedient.
