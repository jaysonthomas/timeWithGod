<chapter><h1>My purpose</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Choosing God</h1>
  My only purpose is to <n>use all of my potential</n> to choose God, every single moment. God is closer than we think. He is never farther than a prayer away.

  <p>
    Courage, guidance and hope, all reside with him.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    How lonely life is! Oh, we can get by in life with a God who does not speak. Many at least think they do so. But it is not much of a life, and it is certainly not the life God intends for us or the abundance of life Jesus came to make available.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This life is available to the chronically unsatisified - restless, demanding, whiners, complainers, the impossible to please.
  </p>

  The soul is pierced by beauty and suffering. Each moment lived outside the awareness of God's presence is a kind of sleepwalk, which is why Paul wrote:
  <blockquote>
    Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.
  </blockquote>

  Frederick Buechner writes: <q>There is no event so commonplace but that God is present within it, always hiddenly, always leaving you room to recognise him or not... because in the last analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is grace.</q>

  In Michelangelo's painting, God comes so close that all Adam would have to do is to lift a finger to connect with God. Having come so close, God allows just a little space, so that Adam can choose. He <n>waits</n> for us to make our move.

  <p>
    Adam could be:
    <ul>
      <li>Indifferent to the possibility of touching his creator</li>
      <li>Making the assumption that God, having come this far, will close the gap</li>
    </ul>

<section><h1>Inspiration</h1>
  Nicholas Herman had had stints in the military and in transportation, and now he was a short-order cook and bottle-washer. But he became deeply dissatisfied with his life; he worried chronically about himself, even whether or not he was saved.

  <p>
    One day Nick was looking at a tree, and the same truth struck him that struck the psalmist so long ago: <n>the secret of the life of a tree is that it remains rooted in something other and deeper than itself</n>. 
  </p>

  He decided to make his life an experiment in what he called a <q>habitual, silent, secret conversation of the soul with God.</q>

  <p>
    He was known by his friends as Brother Lawrence. He remained obscure throughout his life - he stayed in the kitchen. But the people around him found that rivers of living water flowed out of him that made them want to know God the way he did. He found God everywhere, as much while he was repairing shoes as while he was praying with the community.
