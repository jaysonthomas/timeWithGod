<chapter><h1>Practice: Presence of God</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Overview</h1>
  <i>Spiritual Growth</i> involves increasing one's capacity to experience the presence of God.

    <blockquote>
      The most holy and necessary practice in our spiritual life is the presence of God. That means finding constant pleasure in His divine company, speaking humbly and lovingly with him in all seasons, at every moment, without limiting the conversation in any way.

  God is close. This is a faith I can commit myself to.
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Truth</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>God is always present and active in my life, whether or not I see him.</li>
    <li>Every aspect of my life - work, relationships, hobbies, errands - is of immense and genuine interest to God.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Emotions</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>My desire for God ebbs and flows, but his desire for me is constant.</li>

    <p>
      <li>Sometimes God seems far away for reasons I do not understand. Those moments too, are opportunities to learn.</li>
      The difficulty of the task sometimes is what increases the power of discernment (finding Waldo on every page).
    </p>
    <li>Whenever I fail, I can always start again right away.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Risks</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>I am always tempted to live outside this moment. When I do that, I lose my sense of God's presence.</li>
    <li>My path to experiencing God's presence will not look quite like anyone else's.</li>
    <li>No one knows the full extent to which a human being can experience God's presence.</li>
    <li>Straining and trying too hard do not help.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="4"><h1>Practice</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>My task is to meet God in this moment.</li>
    <li>Every thought carries a spiritual charge that moves me a little closer to or a little farther from God.</li>
    <li>Coming to recognise and experience God's presence is learned behaviour; I can cultivate it.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="5"><h1>Example of Jesus</h1>
  No one has ever lived with a sense of the presence of God as Jesus did. He was so dependent on God that he said that everything he did was a result of God's power. He was so surrendered to God that he said his greatest delight was to do the will of his father. He was so confident of God that neither stormy seas nor hostile crowds could shake his poise. The river of life flowed strong through Jesus.
